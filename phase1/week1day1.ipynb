    "Errors should never pass silently.\n",
    "Unless explicitly silenced.\n",
    "In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.\n",
    "There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.\n",
    "Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.\n",
    "Now is better than never.\n",
    "Although never is often better than *right* now.\n",
    "If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.\n",
    "If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.\n",
